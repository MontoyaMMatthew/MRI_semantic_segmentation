Team Members:
Mason Eiland – Team Representative
Matthew Montoya


Tasks:
	Stage 2:

	Both of us will discuss project type, motivation, description,
	what techniques can be used, and research if any related work 
	has been done on the subject.

	Mason - Motivation, problem definition, related works
	Matthew - ML techniques, related works



	Stage 3:

	Both of us looked for datasets that can be used for this project,
	we added a section for each dataset we found that we though would 
	be useful including a description, what it includes, and how it might 
	be used.
	
	Mason - Brain Tumor Image dataset
	Matthew - Cancer Imaging Archive data


	Stage 4:

	Both of us read the chapter on convolutional neural networks from the book.
	We both created a program that matches the annotations containing the information
	on bbox values with their corresponding images for each dataset (train, valid, test).
	We then created a convolutional neural net with a hidden layer to make predictions about
	whether a pixel is tumor or nontumor. Next we created a plot that shows the average loss
	calculated for the training and validation set after each epoch.

	Mason - display image functions, duplicate original dataset so we dont overwrite the orginal, training function, image transformation, train and 	valid_step functions
	Matthew - mask creation function, hidden layer helper function, model creation, plot loss function
